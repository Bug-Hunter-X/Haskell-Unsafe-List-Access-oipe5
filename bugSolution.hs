This corrected version utilizes safe list access methods in Haskell, avoiding potential runtime errors. Pattern matching is employed to check for valid indices before accessing elements, ensuring type safety and preventing out-of-bounds exceptions.

```haskell
safeListAccess :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a
safeListAccess [] _ = Nothing  -- Handle empty list case
safeListAccess (x:_) 0 = Just x -- Access the head
safeListAccess (_:xs) i | i > 0 = safeListAccess xs (i - 1) -- Recursive access
safeListAccess _ _ = Nothing -- Handle out-of-bounds indices
```
