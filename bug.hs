This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation, potentially leading to runtime exceptions. The error occurs when trying to access elements of a list using index-based access, which is not directly supported in Haskell's standard list operations.  Instead, Haskell uses pattern matching or recursion to access elements safely. This function is flawed because it can access indices outside the list's bounds, causing a runtime crash.

```haskell
unsafeListAccess :: [a] -> Int -> a
unsafeListAccess xs i = xs !! i
```
